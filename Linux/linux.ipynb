    "Some differences between shell functions and scripts that you should keep in mind are:\n",
    "    • Functions have to be in the same language as the shell, while scripts can be written in any language. This is why including a shebang for scripts is important.\n",
    "    • Functions are loaded once when their definition is read. Scripts are loaded every time they are executed. This makes functions slightly faster to load, but whenever you change them you will have to reload their definition.\n",
    "    • Functions are executed in the current shell environment whereas scripts execute in their own process. Thus, functions can modify environment variables, e.g. change your current directory, whereas scripts can’t. Scripts will be passed by value environment variables that have been exported using export\n",
    "    • As with any programming language, functions are a powerful construct to achieve modularity, code reuse, and clarity of shell code. Often shell scripts will include their own function definitions.\n",
